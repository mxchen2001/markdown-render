# Markdown Slide

This project was adapted from the working website [demo](https://remarkjs.github.io/react-markdown/) form [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown).

You can write Github Flavored Markdown and when you desire a new slide, simply create a pagebreak using the `@newslide` keyword.
